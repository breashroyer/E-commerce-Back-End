# E-commerce Back End

Description: 
The e-commerce back end is the foundational component of an online retail system that powers the backend operations of an e-commerce website. It includes the server-side logic responsible for managing and handling various aspects of the online store, such as product listings, inventory management, user authentication, order processing, and more.

In a typical e-commerce back end, you'll find a set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that enable communication between the front end (user interface) and the database. These APIs handle requests from the client-side application, perform necessary operations on the database, and return appropriate responses.
